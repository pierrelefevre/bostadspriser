Hi Jim,

We have an idea for the project, the classic house prices predictor except we scrape the data off Hemnet and build a custom model for the Swedish market.

In each listing page, hemnet includes a JSON which their frontend reads from, so scraping should be trivial as we basically just have to parse that JSON.

They also have a service which guesses prices, so does Booli, meaning we could easily compare our solution to the available solutions currently.

Best
